# Pandas 100 Problems

This project contains 100 problems that can be solved using the Pandas library. Each problem has a corresponding Python script in the `problems` directory, a CSV data file in the `data` directory, and a solution script in the `solutions` directory.

## Problem Scripts

The `problems` directory contains 100 Python scripts, each named `problem_X.py`, where `X` is the problem number. These scripts use the Pandas library to solve a specific problem.

## Data Files

The `data` directory contains 100 CSV files, each named `data_X.csv`, where `X` is the problem number. These files contain the data required for the corresponding problem script.

## Solution Scripts

The `solutions` directory contains 100 Python scripts, each named `solution_X.py`, where `X` is the problem number. These scripts provide the solution to the corresponding problem using the Pandas library.

## Git Ignore

The `.gitignore` file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git version control. It is used to exclude files that are not necessary for the project's source code.

## Requirements

The `requirements.txt` file lists the dependencies required for the project. It specifies the version of the Pandas library that should be installed.

## Usage

To solve a specific problem, you can run the corresponding problem script from the `problems` directory. Make sure you have the required data file in the `data` directory.

To check the solution for a problem, you can run the corresponding solution script from the `solutions` directory. The solution script will use the problem script and the data file to provide the solution using the Pandas library.

Feel free to explore the project and solve the problems using the Pandas library!
